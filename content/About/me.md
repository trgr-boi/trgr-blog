Hello, my name is _Trgr_.

I am a guy from Belgium with an interest in all things technology.  
I am a 2nd year student **Applied Computer Science (Toegepaste Informatica) at HoGent**, Belgium. Before this, I did a **bachelors Graphic Design at LUCA Gent**, Belgium.

I have found a passion in everything network related, so I started running my own server(s) at home. I think that I will use this space to explain how I do things, and to look for feedback on how it clould improve.  
For now there is almost nothing, but when I find the time, I will change that!

See you soon!  
_Trgr_
